# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Prior to 1.0.0, security patches will be applied to the **current** version only.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

This repository supports [privately reporting a security vulnerability
](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

If you believe that you have found a security vulnerability, please **do not** file a public issue or disclose it
otherwise. Instead, report it privately via the process described above.

When you report a vulnerability, please include as many details as possible, ideally even a PoC for an exploit. This
will help to significantly speed up the fix and verify that it is indeed resolved.
